Approach,Description,Pros,Cons,Effort,Recommendation
Current Plan (Chaos Monkey),"Custom-built testing framework tailored to OneMindAI","Fully customized, no external dependencies, complete control","Requires development time, maintenance burden",22.75 hrs (AI-assisted),RECOMMENDED
Jest + Supertest,"Use standard Node.js testing libraries","Well-documented, large community, easy setup","Less chaos-focused, need custom chaos logic",15 hrs,Good alternative for API tests only
Playwright,"Use Playwright for E2E testing","Excellent browser automation, cross-browser support","Heavier setup, overkill for API chaos",20 hrs,Good for UI tests only
k6 Load Testing,"Use k6 for load/performance testing","Industry standard, excellent metrics, cloud option","Separate tool, learning curve, Go-based",10 hrs,Good complement for load tests
Artillery,"Use Artillery for load testing","YAML config, easy to use, good reports","Less flexible than custom solution",8 hrs,Good alternative for load tests
Postman/Newman,"Use Postman collections for API testing","Visual interface, easy to share, CI integration","Less programmatic control, paid features",12 hrs,Good for manual API exploration
No Testing,"Skip automated testing, rely on manual QA","Zero development time","High risk, slow, error-prone, not scalable",0 hrs,NOT RECOMMENDED
Hybrid Approach,"Chaos Monkey + k6 + Playwright","Best of all worlds, comprehensive coverage","Multiple tools to maintain, higher complexity",30 hrs,Consider for enterprise scale
